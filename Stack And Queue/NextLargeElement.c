Next larger element

Given an array A [ ] having distinct elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element
of the array in order of their appearance in the array. If no such element exists, output -1

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.Then T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. The
Second line of each test case contains N space separated positive integers denoting the values/elements
in the array A[ ].

output
For each test case, print in a new line, the next greater element for each array element separated by space
in order.

constraint
1 <= |S| <= 10000

Example

Input
14
1 3 2 4

output
3 4 4 -1


Explanation
In the array, the next larger element to 1 is 3 , 3 is 4 , 2 is 4 and for 4 ? since it doesnâ€™t exist hence -1.
